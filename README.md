# Udemy React Course Projects

### How To Run Each Project
*Every folder is a seperate React project.*

1. Navigate to the root folder of a React project (ex. "jsx")
2. Run `npm i --yes` to initialize node packages
3. Run `npm start` to run project on localhost

### Project Takeaways

#### JSX
- using basic functional components
- introduction to JSX syntax
- special attribute names (*className*)
- using style attribute in JSX

#### Components
- nesting components
- using *props* to pass data from parent to child

- using `constructor` and `super()`
- utilizing *state* to render updated content (`setState()`)
- component lifecycle methods (ex. `componentDidMount()`)
- conditional rendering
- linking CSS files to a component
- creating reusable components (*Spinner.js*)
- default props for a component (`.defaultProps`)
- segmenting large dynamic code into parts

- using arrow functions to control the scope of `this` (eliminates need to bind `this` to class)
- handling forms in React

- referencing callback functions without invoking on every render
- creating *refs* to reference DOM node of JSX element
